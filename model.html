      <h3> Cross Sectional View of Straight Wires with a Current, and the Magnetic Field Lines of the Wires</h3>
      <p> The magnetic field lines around a long straight wire with a current form concentric circles around the wire. Using the right hand rule, you can find the direction of the magnetic field by pointing your thumb in the direction of the current and curling the fingers of your right hand around the wire. It is perpendicular to the wire. In this simulation, we display the strength of the magnetic field around a straight wire through the opacity of the vectors in the field: the darker the arrow, the stronger the field. You will notice that the darkest arrows are nearest to the wire, because magnetic field strength depends on the distance from the wire.<br>
	Negative currents go out of the page and are blue colored; Positive currents go into the page and are red colored; No current wires produce no change in the vector field and are colored green.

      <h3>Top-Down View of Two Straight Wires with Current and their Magnetic Fields </h3>
      <p>A long straight wire has a magnetic field due to its current. In the case of a long straight wire with a current I, the magnetic field lines wrap around the wire and the strength of the magnetic field depends on the distance away from the wire. In this simulation, we use conventional notation to show field lines: the "X" are field lines going into the screen, and the "." are field lines going out of the screen. There are options to toggle the current in both the left and right wires. Negative current indicates current moving towards the bottom of the page; positive current is the opposite. The distance between the two wires can be adjusted, which affects the magnetic field on each wire, and when "Update Simulation" is pressed, the magnetic field strength values will be updated, with a determination of whether the wires attract or repel. </p>
      <p> To find magnetic field strength, we used the formula derived from Ampere's Law: <br> <img src="e.png" > <br> where B represents magnetic field strength (in Teslas), Î¼ is the permeability constant, I is the current flowing in the wire, and r is the distance to the wire.  </p>
